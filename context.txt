This is a project that reads Airtable data using their API.

My logical organisation is:
- I ask my TIGER 21 members each month for a World Update.
- I use an Airtable form to capture this data.
- They complete the form.
- I duplicate the form (but not the 'base') every month and generally ask the same questions (the top section of the form)
- This form includes what I call a 'check-in', which includes single-select fields for: Health, Sleep, Business, Relationships, Spirituality, Investments
- Members provide their name in a free form text field, but it should be entered consistently.
- Not all members complete the form, so there will be missing months that we will need to account for.
- The members complete their form but I limit what they can enter by using a field to indicate the update month.

Most of the code needed is already in the files in this project.

I want to write a simple tool will first:
1. Allow the user to enter his API key, which will be saved in the user's local browser storage (with a reset button). This will be in a new page called config.html.
2. Create a page that will list all the bases.
3. Create a cache of all the data in all the tables that are in all the bases. This should be kept in a local json file.
